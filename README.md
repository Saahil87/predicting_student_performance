# Predicitng Student Performance

## Problem definition

Student’s academic performance affected by many factors, like personal, socio-economic and other environmental variables. Knowledge about these factors and their effect on student performance can help in managing their outcomes. The ability to predict student performance is very important in educational environments. Increasing student success is a long term goal in all academic institutions. If educational institutions can predict students’ academic performance early before their final examination, then extra effort can be taken to arrange proper support for the low performing students to improve their studies and help them to success. On the other hand, identifying attributes that affect course success rate can assist in courses improvement. Newly developed web-based educational technologies and the application of quality standard offer researchers’ unique opportunities to study how students learn and what approaches to learning lead to success. The main objective of the synopsis is to identify both factors that affect courses success rate and student success rate then using these factors as early predictor to expected success rate and handling their weakness.
